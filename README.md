## Q1. When was java develope and who is the inventor of java? Why we use java for programming?

** 
Java was developed in 1995 by a team led by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. The development of Java started in 1991 under the project name "Oak," but it was later renamed "Java" when it was officially released. Java is used for programming because it is platform independent, object-oriented, and has a vast library of APIs and tools.  **

## Q2. What are the features of java.
** 
Java has features like Platform-Independent, Object-Oriented, dynamic memory allocation that make it a widely-used programming language. 
**

## Q3. what is JDK, JRE, JVM?
**
JDK (Java Development Kit): The JDK is a software development kit that includes tools and libraries necessary for developing Java applications. It contains the Java compiler, JRE, and other development tools like debuggers and profilers.

JRE (Java Runtime Environment): The JRE provides the necessary libraries, JVM, and other components to run Java applications.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine): The JVM is the engine that runs Java bytecode. It interprets or compiles the bytecode into machine code that can be executed on the host machine. The JVM ensures that Java programs can run on any platform, making Java platform-independent.

## Q4. what is the structure of java program. write a program to print hello world.
**
The structure of a Java program consists of Package Declaration (optional), Import Statements (optional), a class with a main method.
**
```
public class first_demo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		System.out.println("Hello World!");

	}

}
```
## Q5. Define Variables in java. Explain different scope of variable.
**
In Java, a variable is a container that holds data that can be used and manipulated within a program. Each variable has a data type, which defines the type of data it can store.

## Different Scopes of Variables in Java
### Local Variables
Variables declared inside a method, constructor, or block. They are accessible only within the method, constructor, or block where they are declared. They are created when the method or block is entered and destroyed when it exits.

## Q6. Define data types in java.
## Q7. What is type casting in java?
## Q8. Write a program to add two number by taking input from user.
## Q9. Define operator and its type?
## Q10. Write a program individually to perform operators operation.
